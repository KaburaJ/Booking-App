# We made it!
Now that we have created the home, search, game tickets and profile screens, we have created pretty much the whole project. There is room for improvement in terms of making it useful in the real world but so far, so good. To share it with peers publicly, one has to deploy their application. There are several platforms, GitHub Pages being one of them. This [tutorial](https://maheshmnj.medium.com/deploying-your-flutter-webapp-to-github-pages-111ff9e5cbc9) details the procedure clearly.
