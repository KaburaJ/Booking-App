# We made it!
Now that we have created the home, search, game tickets and profile screens, we have created pretty much the whole project.

There are several platforms, GitHub Pages being one of them. This [tutorial](https://maheshmnj.medium.com/deploying-your-flutter-webapp-to-github-pages-111ff9e5cbc9) details the procedure clearly.
