# Booking-App

This repository contains a booking app which targets gaming shops. This app can be accessed [here](https://kaburaj.github.io/Booking-App)

## Overview
This app, though currently more of a UI representation of the end goal, is supposed to be updated by the gaming shop owner. These changes are to be showcased in real time hence the app is dynamic nature. The clients, on the other hand, can now book the available games in advance instead of going to the shop and waiting in line, thus wasting time. To put a spin on it, I thought of categorizing the games in terms of availability and the number of players it requires. For example, the client might opt for a multi-player game at a certain time. This game will remain in the available games tab up until the maximum number of players for that game (usually 2) is reached. 

## Development
In the creation of this application, [Flutter](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-flutter/), which supports cross-platform applications, was used. In my case, I used [FlutLab](https://flutlab.io/) in the execution of code initially. Afterwards, I incorporated VS Code in the final building and eventual deployment to Github pages. No special reason though, the choice of IDE was done based on preference.

### The Nitty Gritties
On opening any Flutter IDE, one is welcomed by a screen with code already on it. In my case, it was the 'Hello World' project. For a smile's sake, I would advice one to run it, feel proud, press and hold Ctrl+A and delete. Well, not everything though.
