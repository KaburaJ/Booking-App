## **bottom_bar.dart**

</br>

The image above is a snippet of the bottom bar. It consists of the `home`, `search`, `games` and `profile` fields. This section attaempts to recreate what is represented by the image above.
</br>
In the ```file explorer``` section of your IDE's interface, you will find the ```lib``` folder. This is where a folder named ```screens``` is created. Within it, I created a ```bottom_bar.dart``` file.

</br>


```dart
class BottomBar extends StatefulWidget {
  const BottomBar({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
  @override
  _WidgetState createState() => _WidgetState();
}

class _WidgetState extends State<BottomBar> {
  int _selectedIndex = 0;
  static final List<Widget> _widgetOptions = <Widget>[
    const HomeScreen(),
    const SearchScreen(),
    const GamesTicketView(),
    const ProfileScreen(),
  ];
  void _onItemTapped(int index) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedIndex = index;
    });
  }
```

The first thing to do was to create a ```stateful widget``` which can be autogenerated by any Flutter IDE. It is as easy as right clicking or hitting some special keys. Once created, I renamed mine to ```BottomBar```. Which was referenced in the ```main.dart``` file. 
</br>
*I think this is a good place to mention that importing the ```'package:flutter/material.dart'``` standard library should be standard practice for each file created to get rid of any errors.*
</br>
Our bottom bar contains the ```home```, ```search```, ```games``` and ```profile``` sections. They are the ones which are referenced as ```HomeScreen()```, ```SearchScreen()```, ```GamesTicketView()``` and ```ProfileScreen()```; each with a separate dart file to be addressed later on. 
</br>
Additionally, an integer type variable, ```_selectedIndex``` has been initialized to zer0. Why, you may ask? Let's dive even deeper.
</br>


```dart
  void _onItemTapped(int index) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedIndex = index;
    });
  }
```

A function, ```_onItemTapped```, is then created. It takes an integer as an argument which is to be stored in the ```index``` variable. The ```setState``` function notifies the framework that the initial state of the object within it has changed. In this case, the object in question is the ```_selectedIndex``` which is re-initialized to the index input. 
</br>


```dart
@override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
```
We then return ```Scaffold```; again, for a default structure. Within it, there are several parameters.
</br>


```dart
body: Center(
        child: _widgetOptions[_selectedIndex],
      ),
```

The first is the definition of the ```body```.  The ```Center``` widget is passed. It centers its child which in this case is the index of the list of icons on the bottom bar. Thus, in retrospect, each Icon in the bottom bar is assigned an index and the code snippet above centers each of these icons to provide an apealing look.
</br>


```dart
bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
          currentIndex: _selectedIndex,
          onTap: _onItemTapped,
          elevation: AppLayout.getHeight(10),
          showSelectedLabels: false,
          showUnselectedLabels: false,
          selectedItemColor: Colors.blueGrey,
          type: BottomNavigationBarType.fixed,
          unselectedItemColor: const Color(0xFF526480),
          items: const [
            BottomNavigationBarItem(
                icon: Icon(FluentSystemIcons.ic_fluent_home_regular),
                activeIcon: Icon(FluentSystemIcons.ic_fluent_home_filled),
                label: "Home"),
```

```bottomNavigationBar``` is up next. It is still within the scaffold. It allows for definition of parameters of the items that go into the bottom bar. ```BottomNavigationBar``` takes a lot of parameters. The ones represented in the code snippet above are a handful of them. They include:
* ```currentIndex``` which stores the index of the current selected item on the bottom bar. It is assigned ```_selectedIndex``` which was initialized earlier.
</br>
* ```onTap``` which checks if any of the items on the bottom bar are selected.
</br>
* ```elevation``` which controls the size of the shadow behind the bottom bar. It is initialized to 10 pixels. However, 10 pixels may vary from phone to phone depending on size and other factors such as height. *That is why the ```app_layout``` library was created. We shall take a look at it pretty soon!*
</br>
* ```showSelectedLabels``` which is set to ```false``` meaning that, for instance, on selecting the home icon, the label ```home``` will not be shown.
</br>
* ```showUnselectedLabels``` which ensures that the labels of the icons, when unselected, remain unseen.
</br>
* ```selectedItemColor``` which is set to a blueGrey colour. Consequently, it is used to set the icon colour when tapped.
</br>
* ```type``` which is set to ```BottomNavigationBarType.fixed``` which ensures that the icons remain in their fixed positions and do not move haphazardly when tapped.
</br>
* ```unselectedItemColor``` which defines the colour of the icons when they are not selected.
</br>
* ```items``` which defines the appearance of the icons on the bottom bar. For this, instead of using the default icons in the material library, another library was imported. It is called the ```FluentSystemIcons``` library. 
</br>
To import this library, we head on to the ```pubspec.yaml``` file on the explorer section.
</br>


```dart
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
    
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
  fluentui_icons: ^1.0.0
```

```fluentui_icons: ^1.0.0```  should be added to the ```dependencies``` section of the ```pubspec.yaml``` file.  It will resemble the snippet above. Afterwards ```pub get``` should be selected and just like that, a library will have been imported into the streamlit app. 
</br>
*In the ```bottom_dart``` file, import ```'package:fluentui_icons/fluentui_icons.dart'``` to be able to use the new icons in your application*
</br>


```dart
          items: const [
            BottomNavigationBarItem(
                icon: Icon(FluentSystemIcons.ic_fluent_home_regular),
                activeIcon: Icon(FluentSystemIcons.ic_fluent_home_filled),
                label: "Home"),
```

Getting back to the ```items``` section of the code, we will go through the home icon. This will be similar for all four icons except for the label.
```items``` is a list and within it is a ```BottomNavigationBarItem``` widget which takes in ```icon``` as an argument. Here, I selected the ```FluentSystemIcons.ic_fluent_home_regular``` which is basically an outline of a home icon. For the ```activeIcon``` section, the filled version of the home icon was selected. That way when selected, this icon got filled and when unselected, it was not.

Having created our bottom bar, let us move on to the next section. Next up, we have [utils](https://github.com/KaburaJ/Booking-App#utils)
